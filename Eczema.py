    ## Eczema Information
    Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a condition that makes your skin red and itchy. It's common in children but can occur at any age. Eczema is long-lasting (chronic) and tends to flare periodically. It may be accompanied by asthma or hay fever.
    
    ### Symptoms
    - Dry skin
    - Itching, which may be severe, especially at night
    - Red to brownish-gray patches, especially on the hands, feet, ankles, wrists, neck, upper chest, eyelids, inside the bend of the elbows and knees, and in infants, the face and scalp
    - Small, raised bumps, which may leak fluid and crust over when scratched
    - Thickened, cracked, scaly skin
    - Raw, sensitive, swollen skin from scratching
    
    ### Treatment
    Treatment includes self-care measures, lifestyle changes, and various medications. Moisturizers, corticosteroid creams, and avoiding irritants are common ways to manage eczema. In more severe cases, prescription medications and light therapy might be recommended.
