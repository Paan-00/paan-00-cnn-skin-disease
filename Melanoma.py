    ## Melanoma Information
    Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer. It develops in the cells (melanocytes) that produce melanin â€” the pigment that gives your skin its color. Melanoma can also form in your eyes and, rarely, inside your body, such as in your nose or throat.
    
    ### Symptoms
    - A change in an existing mole
    - The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin
    - Asymmetry: One half of the mole doesn't match the other half
    - Border: Edges are irregular, ragged, notched, or blurred
    - Color: Includes different shades of brown or black, or patches of pink, red, white, or blue
    - Diameter: The spot is larger than 6 millimeters across (about the size of a pencil eraser)
    - Evolving: The mole is changing in size, shape, or color
    
    ### Treatment
    Treatment for melanoma includes surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biological therapy, and targeted therapy. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment.
